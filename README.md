#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

- **`var`** is function-scoped, not block-scoped. **`let`** is block-scoped and only accessible within curly braces `{}`. **`const`** is also block-scoped.

- **`var`** is hoisted to the top of its function scope and initialized as `undefined`. In contrast, **`let`** remains in the `temporal dead zone` until it is initialized. **`const`** is also hoisted, but like let, it stays in the `temporal dead zone` until initialization.

- **`var`** allows both `re-declaration` and `re-assignment`. **`let`** does not allow `re-declaration` but does allow `re-assignment`. On the other hand, const allows neither `re-declaration` or `re-assignment`.



#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
